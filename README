VTKDemos
========

A small set of VTK6 examples including the datasets.
* intro: Very simple pipeline setup.
* ray_cast_spheres: Geometry shader example
* isosurfaces: Countours and cut planes on a scalar field.
* volume_rendering: Simple pipeline for volume rendering
* streamlines: Vector field visualization using stream ribbons. Ribbons are
seeded with a plane widget.

The compilation scripts require VTK 6, although it's possible that the examples
also compile with VTK 5.
